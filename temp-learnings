tsc vs tsup
tsc is ts compiler, Can be configured using tsconfig.json
tsup is used for optimised bundling for production

plan for today:
why do I have to refresh after add and delete
create hooks and use react query for get and add
push code to github

Other
implement edit
implement login page (stretch)
filter occassions by month, name, type

tsconfig.json - rules are not working

Other ideas
common types used on fe and backend - should these be in some package? Or move them to the place where you're adding the db model and schema
pagination - only see some occassions on the page
